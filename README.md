# sei_modeling_downstream
Sei is systematically predicting sequence regulatory activities, applying sequence information to human genetics data. It's a global map from any sequence to regulatory activities by 40 sequence classes, and each sequence class integrates predictions for 21,907 chromatin profiles . I utilize this model for Short Tandem Repeat downstream analysis.
